    <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[8] The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[9][10] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms,[14] some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.[9][15] As of 25 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.5 percent; however, it ranges from 0.2 percent to 15 percent, according to age group and other health problems.</p>

<h2><em>India</em> Response</h2>
<p>The future of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was dependent on the response of India, a highly and densely-populated country, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on March 23, 2020.

The trajectory of the virus would be determined by how aggressive and sustained the action of highly populous countries like India was in dealing with the outbreak, Mike Ryan, WHO emergencies programme director, said in a press conference at the organisation’s headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

“India led the world in killing two silent but very big killers — smallpox and polio — and gave a great gift to the world. It has tremendous capacities,” Ryan said. He added these two diseases could be eliminated due to robust surveillance networks which now needed to be employed in finding suspected COVID-19 patients.

The WHO panel maintained that aggressive case finding by ramping up testing was a key weapon. If India, or any country was falling short of testing kits, then they had to adopt the WHO guidelines on how to prioritise testing according to the foreseeable future.

Testing has been a grey area for India as it has only tested a little over 18,000 samples when many other are testing several thousands per week. Indian Council of Medical Research Director General Balarama Bhargava has said on a number of occasions that India does not believe in indiscriminate testing.

Ryan stressed that aggressive testing did not mean indiscriminate testing. “No, we are not saying everybody should be tested. But we say patients even with pneumonia (who do not necessarily have symptoms) should be, along with those who have a history of international travel or contacts,” Ryan said.

Shutdown is no future

If the kits are scarce, WHO officials said they had guidelines on how to prioritise testing and tailor guidance to countries depending upon the stage of transmission. “Every country should see how to increase production of testing kits so that we can fight the virus without being blindfolded,” Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead, WHO, said.</p>
